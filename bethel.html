        <section>
        <p>There are lots of pieces to think about when creating a webpage. Here’s a quick guide to the most basic elements.</p>
        
        <h1>1 .Page Title</h1>

        <ul>
        <p>If we’ve done our job well, the page title should tell visitors exactly what they’ll find on the webpage.</p>

        <li>Keep it short Use clear language</li>
        <li>Make the first two words count</li>
        <li>Avoid internal jargon or acronyms</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>2. ID</h1>

        <ul>
        <p>The ID is a label assigned to the webpage that will appear at the end of the url.</p>

        <li>Use hyphens between words.</li>
        <li>Never use underscores or other characters.</li>
        <li>No capital letters.</li>
        <li>Use words that make sense.</li>
        <li>In almost every case, your page ID should use words found in your page title.</li>
        <li>Don't use obscure acronyms or abbreviations.</li>
        </ul>  

        <h1>3. Description</h1>
        
        <ul>
        <p>The description is a one-sentence summary of your page.It’s important to use key words and phrases that you think visitors might be using as search terms.</p>
        
        <li>Where your description might show up:</li>
        <li>Google search results page</li>
        <li>Facebook, comments threads, or any other website where someone might post a link to your page</li>
        </ul> 
        <h1>4. Body</h1>
        
        <ul>
        <p>The body is the bulk of your webpage content. It’s the information you’re providing to help visitors complete their tasks.</p>
        
        <li>Put your information in priority order with the most important information first.</li>
        <li>Use short words, sentences, and paragraphs.</li>
        <li>Think about your user first. What is the information that they want to know?</li>
        <li>Are you using language that your users understand?</li>
        <li>Never use all caps unless it's a predefined style you cannot control. Use bold instead if you're wanting to convey emphasis.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>5. Headings</h1>
        
        <ul>

        <p>Headings help users scan and find information quickly so they can assess if they're in the right place.</p>
       
        <li>Accurately describe the information in the section.</li>
        <li>Be clear and concrete.</li>
        <li>Use key terms or phrases that are relevant for users.</li>
        <li>Use powerful and active words.</li>
        <p>When formatting your headings, use H2 for main headings and H3 for subheadings. Re-evaluate your content if you're needing H4 because your page can get messy in a hurry.</li>    
        </ul>

        <h1>6. Lists</h1>
        
        <ul>
        <p>A list is a helpful tool for breaking down huge paragraphs or providing step-by-step instructions.</p>
        
        <li>Start with a capital letter.</li>
        <li>Place a period at the end of complete sentences.</li>
        <li>Use parallel language for list items (all fragments, all complete sentences, all questions, etc.).</li>
        <li>Use numbers if you’re outlining a process or concrete steps that a visitor needs to take.</li>
        <li>Visitors usually only see the first 2 words for each list item, so make those first 2 words meaningful.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>7. Bold, Italics, and Underline</h1>

        <ul>
        <p>On the web, bold, italics, and underline each have a unique purpose.</p>
        <p>Bold</p>

        <p>Use bold for highlighting important info, such as an application deadline or fee. You can also use bold for key introductory phrases of bulleted lists.</p>
        <p>Words of advice: if bold is overused, it’s no longer helpful. When too much is emphasized nothing stands out.</p>
        <p>Italics</p>
        <p>Use italics according to the <a href="http://">Bethel Style Guide:</a>
        </p><a href="http://">Bethel Style Guide:</a>
        
        <li>Book titles</li>
        <li>Movie titles</li>
        <li>Titles of newspapers or publications</li>
        <li>Other items as noted in the style guide</li>
        <p>Italics can also be used to consistently format a repeated piece of minor information.</p>
        <p>Examples:</p>
        <li>Room locations on schedule of events for a conference</li>
        <li>Job titles on a staff list</li>
        <p>Underline</p>
        <p>Never underline text on the web. Visitors will mistake underlined text for a link. This leads to confusion and reduces the impact of what you were trying to highlight. Use bold for emphasis instead.</p>
        </ul>

         <h1>8.Links</h1>
                <ul>
                    <p>Hyperlink meaningful phrases rather than single words or words that lack context.</p>

                    <li>Phrases are easier to spot.</li>
                     <li>Meaningful words help search engines scan and pick up useful information.</li>
                     <li>Avoid using "here" and "click here."</li>

                     <p>Alert visitors when links will lead them to a document instead of a webpage by adding the appropriate tag at the end of the link:</p>
                     <li>Bethel Undergraduate Catalog (pdf)</li>
                     <li>Bethel Style Guide (doc)</li>
                     <li>Bethel Expense Report (xls)</li>

                </ul>
            
        <h1>9. Call to Action</h1>

        <p>Nearly all webpages should provide visitors with a call to action. What do we want them to do with this information? What task have they come to perform?</p>
        <p>It’s helpful to always give visitors a place to go from each webpage that’s related to the task at hand.</p>
